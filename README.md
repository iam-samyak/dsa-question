## Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms are fundamental building blocks for writing efficient and optimized computer programs. This repository aims to provide various DSA questions along with their C++ solutions to help learners understand these concepts better.

The primary goals of this repository are:
- To provide implementations of common DSA problems in C++.
- To help learners grasp the logic and techniques used to solve these problems.
- To serve as a resource for interview preparation and competitive programming.

## How to Use

You can use this repository in the following ways:

1. **Exploring Solutions**: Browse through the different folders to find the implementation of specific DSA questions. Each folder will contain the C++ code for the problem along with any necessary helper functions or classes.

2. **Contributing**: If you have a new solution to add or want to improve existing ones, contributions are always welcome! Please see the [Contributing](#contributing) section for guidelines.

3. **Interview Preparation**: Use these solutions to practice for technical interviews. Try solving the problems yourself first, and then compare your solutions with the ones in this repository to gain insights into different approaches.
